TODO:

x graph knn
x node features + adj matrix
    x env
    x model
x dqn vectorized
x model vectorized
x edge features
x layer parameters
x don't clear replay buffer on env.reset()
- one replay buffer per graph size
- hyperparameters from appendix
    - learning rate exponential decay
    - epsilon linear decay
- episodes = #minibatches / #avg vertices per episode
- (normalize sums) try replacing sum with avg in TSP model when computing graph embedding
- generate graphs from same distribution from paper

x negate reward
x fix run on GPU
x implement nstep
x represent state properly
x implement agent.learn
x test act
x test learn
x implement training loop
x test step
x implement validation with exact solution, calc'd by DP TSP
x target network (?) with hard/soft update
- revisit docstrings
